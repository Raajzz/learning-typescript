## Core Types
- number -> 1, 5.3, -1
- string -> 'Hi', "Hi", `Hi`
- boolean -> true, false (truthy(1) and falsy values aren't included)
- TS is statically typed, they don't suddenly change when it's running. But Nothing can run TS therefore it isn't like you'll get a run-time error, but you get the gist.
